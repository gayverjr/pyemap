PyeMap is a python package aimed at automatic identification of electron and hole transfer
pathways in proteins. The analysis is based on a coarse-grained version of Beratan and
Onuchicâ€™s Pathway model, and only accounts for through-space hopping between
aromatic residues side chains [Beratan1992]_. Side chains of aromatic residues and non-protein electron
transfer active moieties are modeled as vertices in a weighted graph, where the edge
weights are modified distance dependent penalty functions. Shortest path algorithms are
used to compute the shortest pathways from a specified electron or hole donor to the
surface of the protein, or to a user-specified acceptor.


PyeMap analysis happens in 3 steps. The first step is parsing a PDB or CIF file provided
by the user or fetched from the RCSB_ database. The next step is constructing the
graph theory model of the protein crystal structure. Finally, the shortest paths between a
specified electron/hole source to the surface or to a specified electron/hole acceptor are calculated.

PyeMap is intended to be used as the backend for the web application
eMap_, and as a standalone python package.

Current Features
----------------
* Accepts valid .pdb or .cif structures provided by the user or fetched from RCSB_ database
* Tested on structures as large as 5350 residues (51599 atoms)
* Automatic detection of non-protein aromatic moieties such as porphyrins, nucleobases, and other aromatic cofactors
* Automatic detection of 60+ inorganic clusters such as iron-sulfur clusters and others
* Automatic identification of surface exposed residues using residue depth or solvent accessibility criteria
* Visualization of chemical structures and graphs
* User specified custom fragments

* Identification of most probable electron/hole transfer pathways from a specified donor to the protein surface or a specified electron/hole acceptor

In Development
----------------
* Tools for screening families of proteins for common electron/hole transfer pathways
* Generalization to DNA, protein-DNA, and other relevant biomolecules
* Improving the physical model of electron transfer by incorporating information on geometry-dependent electronic couplings and chemical-dependent energetics
