==============================
The :py:class:`~pyemap.graph_mining.PDBGroup` object is the primary data structure for 
graph mining analysis in PyeMap. It stores the :py:class:`~pyemap.emap` objects which contain 
the graph theory models of the protein structures, the graph database defined by the classifications 
of nodes and edges, and the results of the mining calculation.
