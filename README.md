PyeMap is a Python package aimed at automatic identification of electron and hole transfer pathways in proteins. It is intended to serve as the backend for the web application [eMap](https://emap.bu.edu), and as a standalone package.

# Installation
For more detailed instructions, specifically on getting nicer looking graphs from graphviz please see the [documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyemap/).
#### Conda(recommended):
The conda recipe will install all dependencies necessary for full functionality.
```
# create new virtual environment
$ conda create -n pyemap_env
$ conda activate pyemap_env
#include channels for dependencies, only needs to be done once
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge --add channels salilab --add channels bioconda 
$ conda update --all
# install pyemap
$ conda install -c gayverjr pyemap
```
For full functionality, you can download and install [MSMS](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS), [DSSP](https://github.com/cmbi/xssp/releases), and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) separately. 
### Pip
Pip installation will only install python dependencies, which is sufficient to run PyeMap analysis, but will be missing some features such as surface exposure and visualization. 
```
pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pyemap
```
