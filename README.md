PyeMap is a Python package aimed at automatic identification of electron and hole transfer pathways in proteins.
It serves as the backend for the web application [eMap](https://emap.bu.edu/), and can also be used as a fully functional Python package.

- **Documentation:** https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyemap/
- **Website:** https://emap.bu.edu

# Installation

### Pip
Pip installation will only install python dependencies, and requires [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) in order to work. This is sufficient to run PyeMap analysis and view graph images, but some features will be missing.
```
pip install pyemap
```
For full functionality, install [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html), [MUSCLE](https://www.drive5.com/muscle/), [MSMS](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS) (not available on Mac OS Catalina and later), and [DSSP](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/DSSP_3.html), all of which can be downloaded free of charge from their owners, and are available on most platforms. 

# Getting started
Please see our tutorials for [single](https://pyemap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/single_protein.html) and [multiple](https://pyemap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/mining.html) protein analysis to help get started using PyeMap. We also provide sample Jupyter notebooks in the examples directory.

# Bugs and feature requests
Please report any bugs and make feature requests [here](https://github.com/gayverjr/pyemap/issues). For issues exclusive to the web version [eMap](https:emap.bu.edu), please send an email to <emap.bu@gmail.com>. We also greatly encourage users to contribute by making pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/gayverjr/pyemap)!
